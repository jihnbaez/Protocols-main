 ## Exercise - Create a Protocol
 
 Create a protocol called `Vehicle` with two requirements: a nonsettable `numberOfWheels` property of type `Int`, and a function called `drive()`.

/*:
 Define a `Car` struct that implements the `Vehicle` protocol. `numberOfWheels` should return a value of 4, and `drive()` should print "Vroom, vroom!" Create an instance of `Car`, print its number of wheels, then call `drive()`.

/*:
 Define a `Bike` struct that implements the `Vehicle` protocol. `numberOfWheels` should return a value of 2, and `drive()` should print "Begin pedaling!". Create an instance of `Bike`, print its number of wheels, then call `drive()`.
